            <p class="general">What's wrong with the world, mama?<br> 
            People livin' like they ain't got no mamas<br> 
            I think the whole world's addicted to the <span class="drama">drama</span><br> 
            Only attracted to things that'll bring you <span class="drama">trauma</span><br><br> 

            Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism<br> 
            But we still got terrorists here livin'<br> 
            In the USA, the big CIA<br> 
            The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK<br><br> 

            But if you only have love for your <span class="drama">own race</span><br> 
            Then you only leave space to <span class="drama">discriminate</span><br> 
            And to discriminate only generates <span class="drama">hate</span><br> 
            And when you hate, then you're bound to get <span class="drama">irate</span>, yeah<br><br> 

            <span class="drama">Madness</span> is what you demonstrate<br> 
            And that's exactly how anger works and operates<br> 
            <span class="meditate">Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight<br> 
            Take control of your mind and meditate<br> 
            Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all</span><br><br> </p>

            <p class="prechorus">People killin', people dyin'<br> 
            Children hurt, hear them cryin'<br> 
            <span class="practice">Can you practice what you preach<br> 
            Or would you turn the other cheek?</span><br><br></p> 

            <p class="chorus"><span class="father">Father, Father, Father, help us!</span><br> 
            Send some guidance from above<br> 
            'Cause people got me, got me questionin'<br> 
            Where is the <span class="love">love (love)</span><br><br> 

            Where is the <span class="love">love?</span> (The <span class="love">love</span>)<br> 
            Where is the <span class="love">love?</span> (The <span class="love">love</span>)<br> 
            Where is the <span class="love">love</span>, the <span class="love">love</span>, the <span class="love">love</span>?<br><br></p> 

            <p class="general">It just ain't the same, old ways have changed<br> 
            New days are strange, <span class="drama">is the world insane?</span><br> 
            If love and peace are so strong <br>
            Why are there pieces of love that don't belong? <br><br>

            Nations droppin' <span class="drama">bombs</span> <br>
            <span class="drama">Chemical gasses</span> fillin' lungs of little ones <br>
            With ongoin' <span class="drama">sufferin'</span> as the youth die young <br>
            So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone? <br><br>

            So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong <br>
            In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in <br>
            Makin' <span class="drama">wrong decisions</span>, only visions of them dividends <br>
            Not respectin' each other, <span class="drama">deny thy brother</span> <br>
            A <span class="drama">war</span> is goin' on but the reason's undercover <br><br>

            The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug <br>
            If you never know truth then you never know love <br>
            Where's the love, y'all, come on? (I don't know) <br>
            Where's the truth, y'all, come on? (I don't know) <br>
            Where's the love, y'all? <br><br></p>

            <p class="prechorus">People killin', people dyin' <br>
            Children hurt, hear them cryin' <br>
            <span class="practice">Can you practice what you preach <br>
            Or would you turn the other cheek? </span><br><br></p>

            <p class="chorus"><span class="father">Father, Father, Father, help us!</span><br>
            Send some guidance from above <br>
            'Cause people got me, got me questionin' <br>
            Where is the <span class="love">love (love)</span><br><br> 

            Where is the <span class="love">love</span>? (The <span class="love">love</span>)<br> 
            Where is the <span class="love">love</span>? (The <span class="love">love</span>)<br> 
            Where is the <span class="love">love</span>, the <span class="love">love</span>, the <span class="love">love</span>?<br><br></p> 

            <p class="general">I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder <br>
            As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder <br>
            Most of us only care about <span class="drama">money makin' </span><br>
            <span class="drama">Selfishness</span> got us followin' the wrong direction <br><br>

            <span class="drama">Wrong information</span> always shown by the media <br>
            Negative images is the main criteria <br>
            <span class="drama">Infecting the young minds</span> faster than bacteria <br>
            Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema, yo' <br><br>

            <span class="drama">Whatever happened to the values of humanity? <br>
            Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? <br>
            Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity <br>
            Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity</span> <br><br>

            That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under <br>
            That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down <br>
            There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under <br>
            Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found <br>
            Now ask yourself <br><br></p>

            <p class="chorus">Where is the <span class="love">love</span>?<br>
            Where is the <span class="love">love</span>?<br>
            Where is the <span class="love">love</span>?  <br><br>


            <span class="father">Father, Father, Father, help us!</span><br>
            Send some guidance from above <br>
            'Cause people got me, got me questionin' <br>
            Where is the <span class="love">love</span>?<br><br></p>

            <p class="general">Sing with me y'all (<span class="drama">one world, one world</span>) <br>
            We only got (<span class="drama">one world, one world</span>)<br>
            That's all we got (<span class="drama">one world, one world</span>)<br><br></p>
